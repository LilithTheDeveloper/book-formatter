# book-formatter
A simple formatter written in Python that helps converting markdown files to a PDF using pandoc and pdflatex. This was made during the writing process of my book. 


## Features
- It removes frontmatters completely
- Allows for ordered PDF generation through frontmatter tag `chapter_order`
- Custom DIVs with the help of Lua Script
